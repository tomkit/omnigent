# Decides whether a PR's diff should be put through the Security Scan.
# Called by .github/workflows/security-gate.yml.
#
# We scan UNTRUSTED authors and skip trusted ones. "Trusted" is GitHub's
# native author_association: OWNER / MEMBER / COLLABORATOR -- people with a
# direct relationship to the repo/org. Everyone else is scanned, INCLUDING
# returning CONTRIBUTORs (a merged PR in the past does not vouch for the
# contents of this one) and first-timers (FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR / NONE).
#
# This is deliberately stricter than fork-e2e/should-mirror.sh, which trusts
# CONTRIBUTOR: that gate only decides whether to spend a rate-limited test
# token, whereas this gate decides whether to inspect for attacks, so it errs
# toward scanning more.
#
# author_association is computed by GitHub from the actor's relationship to the
# repo at event time; it is not attacker-settable from PR contents.
