/**
 * Service-worker registration + update detection for the standalone PWA.
 *
 * Thin wrapper around `workbox-window` (kept instead of `vite-plugin-pwa` so we
 * ship ~3 small packages, not the ~250-package `workbox-build` toolchain — see
 * the service worker at `sw-src/sw.js`). `workbox-window` is the part with real
 * value: it handles the lifecycle edge cases a hand-rolled registration gets
 * wrong — notably a worker that was ALREADY `waiting` when the page loaded.
 *
 * The wiring lives at module scope, not inside the React effect, on purpose:
 *   - registration happens exactly once even though `<PWAUpdateBanner>` mounts
 *     under `<StrictMode>` (which double-invokes effects), and
 *   - the `waiting`/`controlling` listeners are attached once and never churn,
 *     so an event can't slip through between an effect's cleanup and re-run.
 * The hook is a pure subscriber to that module-level state.
