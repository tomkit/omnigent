"""MCP startup band lifecycle on the session page.

A codex-native session boots its harness MCP servers when its thread
starts; the forwarder mirrors that round as ``external_mcp_startup``
posts and the web chat must show it — an otherwise-idle session used to
look hung for the whole boot (and forever, when servers failed). These
tests drive the real per-server maps through the Sessions events route
(the same path the codex-native forwarder posts to), so they are
deterministic — no live codex TUI, whose MCP round timing would make the
assertions flaky. The forwarder-side synthesis/settle bookkeeping is
covered by the codex_native_forwarder unit tests.
