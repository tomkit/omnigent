"""Build-output guard for the PWA embed island.

Companion to ``conftest._assert_pwa_build`` (which guards the *standalone* SPA
build in the ``built_spa`` fixture): this asserts the **embed island** ships no
service worker or web manifest. The island is mounted inside a host application
(e.g. Databricks), so it must never register a SW or precache anything — that is
why ``vite.embed.config.ts`` omits the ``emitPwaAssets`` plugin and never mounts
``PWAUpdateBanner``. A regression that added either would hijack the host page's
origin with our service worker.

Note: the install icons under ``public/`` *are* copied into the embed output
(Vite copies ``publicDir`` for every build) — but they are inert images. Only a
service worker or web manifest could affect the host's origin, so those (plus
the ``workbox-`` runtime) are precisely what this guard forbids.

Part of the gated e2e suite (needs ``npm`` + a vite build); see this package's
``conftest`` module docstring for how the suite is run and excluded from the
default ``pytest`` run.
